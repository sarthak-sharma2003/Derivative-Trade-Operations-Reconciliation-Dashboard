## 🔑 Setting Up the API Key

Before you run the project, make sure you set up your **Alpha Vantage API Key** correctly:
1. Create a `.env` file in the **backend** directory.
2. Add your API key to the file like this:
```sh
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=Your_API_Key_Here
```
3. The project will automatically use this key when fetching trade data.

If you don't add a key, the app uses a placeholder key for testing, but keep in mind the rate limits of the free API tier.
